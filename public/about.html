                    <h2>A Message from the Founder</h2>
                    <p>
                        Like you, I've experienced the frustrations of
                        navigating professional requirements. As a PRC-licensed
                        Real Estate Broker, Appraiser, and Consultant, I know
                        what it's like to chase CPD units before renewal ‚Äî
                        joining random Viber groups, scrambling to find seminars
                        at the last minute, and digging through email threads
                        just to locate certificates. Every renewal season, it
                        felt like the same headache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the challenge isn't only for licensed professionals.
                        Aspiring practitioners preparing for exams often
                        struggle to find the right review classes to feel
                        confident on licensure day. Many practicing agents and
                        unlicensed persons want to transition into licensed
                        roles but don't always know where to start. And
                        providers spend more time on marketing and admin than on
                        actually teaching and supporting their students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>That's why I built this portal.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>This platform is designed for four groups:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>For aspiring professionals</strong> ‚Äî to
                            find trusted review classes that prepare you for
                            licensure.
                        </li>

                            >
                            ‚Äî to explore pathways and programs that help you
                            transition into licensed roles under RESA.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>For licensed practitioners</strong> ‚Äî to
                            track CPD credits, store certificates securely, and
                            get reminders before renewal. No more lost papers or
                            forgotten deadlines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>For providers and institutions</strong> ‚Äî to
                            reach your audience more easily. Instead of
                            struggling with design tools and endless Facebook
                            boosting, you can generate a seminar page and poster
                            instantly, with your accreditation and CPD units
                            front and center.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Beyond convenience, this portal also offers a clear and
                        lawful pathway for unlicensed practitioners to upgrade
                        into licensed roles under the RESA Law. This is my
                        contribution to uplifting the real estate profession ‚Äî
                        reducing shortcuts, encouraging compliance, and helping
                        raise the overall standards of practice in the
                        Philippines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vision is simple: to make professional growth less
                        of a burden, and more of a clear path you can manage
                        with confidence. This isn't just another tech project.
                        It's built by someone who has faced the same
                        frustrations, and who understands the standards and
                        credibility that professionals demand.

                        I hope this portal becomes a tool that saves you time,
                        reduces stress, and helps you focus on what really
                        matters: advancing in your profession and serving your
                        clients.
