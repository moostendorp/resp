                    <p>
                        We're building the first dedicated platform for every
                        stage of a real estate career in the Philippines. From
                        aspiring professionals preparing for board exams to
                        licensed practitioners seeking CPD compliance, resp.ph
                        connects you with the education and training you need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our platform addresses the fragmented nature of real
                        estate education in the Philippines. Currently, finding
                        accredited CPD seminars, quality review classes, or
                        university programs requires searching through multiple
                        sources, social media groups, and word-of-mouth
                        recommendations. We're changing that by creating a
                        centralized, trustworthy marketplace where education
                        meets opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is simple: make quality real estate education
                        accessible, transparent, and easy to find for everyone
                        in the industry.

                        unprecedented growth, with increasing demand for
                        qualified professionals. However, the path from aspiring
                        to licensed practitioner remains challenging:
